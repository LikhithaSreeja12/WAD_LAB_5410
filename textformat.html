<br>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, <small>and are all related to a single topic</small>. <em>Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs</em>. <strong>This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end</strong>, and<i> thus help the reader see the organization of the essay </i>and <sub>grasp its main points</sub>.</br>

<p>Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point. <br>It might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or describe causes and effects</br>. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these is a topic sentence.</p>
